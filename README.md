# CoCo3_3D_Pixel_animation
Code to show how to draw and erase many dots on the CoCo 3

To actually make your own from this source code requires a special compressor/loader that is currently in many pieces.  The code is here for anyone who wants to learn from it.  There are two ready to load and use disk images.  Put DISK1.DSK in drive 0 and DISK2.DSK in drive 1 and on the CoCo 3 type RUN"LOADER:1

Have fun,
Glen
